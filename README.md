## ✨ Why Choose Our Framework?

The market is flooded with low-tier tools that lead to immediate account flags. We have built our architecture on three core pillars: **Privacy, Velocity, and Seamless Integration.** 🛡️

### 👤 System Integrity

Our module operates at a low system level, ensuring complete invisibility from standard client-side detection algorithms. We use unique memory injection methods that keep the utility secure and undetected.

### ⚡ Zero-Latency Execution

Macros trigger faster than the human nervous system can react. Your sequences will be frame-perfect, even under high-latency conditions.

### ⚙️ Adaptive Profiles

Choose your depth of involvement. Use **"Legit Mode"** for subtle analytical help or **"Full Performance"** for maximum mechanical automation.
